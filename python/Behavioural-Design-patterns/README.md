# Behavioural Design Patterns

Behavioural design patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects. They help make complex flows more manageable, flexible, and extensible by defining clear ways for objects to communicate and interact.

## What are Behavioural Patterns?

Behavioural patterns focus on how objects collaborate and delegate tasks. They:
- Define how objects interact and communicate.
- Assign clear responsibilities to each object.
- Make it easier to change the flow of a program without modifying existing code.

---

## When Should You Use Them?

Use behavioural patterns when you want to:
- Improve communication between objects.
- Avoid tightly coupled code.
- Make your codebase more flexible and maintainable.
- Implement complex workflows or business rules.

---

## Patterns Included

- [Strategy Design Pattern](../Behavioural-Design-patterns/strategy-design-pattern/README.md): Select an algorithm's behavior at runtime.

---

## Example Use Cases

- **Strategy Pattern**: Switching between different sorting algorithms in a data processing app.
- **Observer Pattern**: Notifying multiple modules when a user updates their profile.
- **Command Pattern**: Implementing undo/redo functionality in a text editor.
