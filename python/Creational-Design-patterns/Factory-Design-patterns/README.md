# Factory Design Patterns (Python)

This section covers the Factory family of design patterns, which help in creating objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created.

---

## Patterns Included

- [Simple Factory Pattern](./simple-factory/README.md): Centralizes object creation logic in a single factory class.
- [Factory Method Pattern](./factory-method/README.md): Lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate.

---

## What are Factory Patterns?

Factory patterns abstract the process of object creation, allowing code to be more flexible and decoupled from specific classes. They are especially useful when the exact types of objects to create are not known until runtime.

---

## Example Use Cases
- Decoupling client code from concrete classes
- Allowing frameworks to delegate object creation to user code
- Managing families of related objects
